## Project Overview

The **USGS Earthquake Map** is an interactive web visualization of global seismic activity. Using real-time data from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), this project plots earthquakes by magnitude, overlays tectonic plate boundaries, and allows users to explore patterns through map layers and visual cues.

Originally built as a hands-on geospatial exercise, this dashboard illustrates the power of public data and open-source tools in helping us better understand our planet‚Äôs dynamic crust.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map** built with Leaflet.js and D3  
- üåç **Real-time USGS earthquake data** with size and color-coded markers  
- üî• **Heatmap overlay** for frequency and density  
- üß≠ **Tectonic plate boundaries** toggleable for geologic context  
- üß© **Custom basemaps and layers** with full toggle control  
- üì± **Mobile-responsive layout**

## Tools & Technologies

- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Core logic and interaction  
- **Leaflet.js** ‚Äì Map rendering and layer control  
- **D3.js** ‚Äì GeoJSON handling and data formatting  
- **USGS GeoJSON Feed** ‚Äì Earthquake data API  
- **Tectonic Plate Data** ‚Äì Overlay from open GeoJSON sources  
- **HTML/CSS** ‚Äì Structure and layout  
- **GitHub Pages** ‚Äì Deployment


## Usage

Visit the live site [here](https://johbry17.github.io/USGS-Earthquake-Map/).  
Use the layer control to:
- Switch between multiple base maps.
- Toggle earthquake markers, tectonic plates, and heatmaps.
- Explore real-time USGS data in geographic context.
